In urban life, public transportation serves as a lifeline for citizens, ensuring smooth and efficient mobility. However, the punctuality and reliability of bus services often face challenges due to the unpredictable nature of weather, varying passenger loads and other factors. These factors are critical in influencing the overall efficacy of public transit systems. So, we aim to provide a more accurate method for predicting travel time between bus stations. 

Our stakeholders are LTA (Land Transport Authority) and passengers. With this project, we hope we can predict station-to-station intervals using passenger flow, rainfall, distance, and date. Then for LTA, we hope we can help them to optimize bus schedules and offer higher-quality services. Also, we can help them to monitor the operation of bus systems and provide data support for decision making. For passengers, we want to provide them with a platform to input departure and destination stops to estimate bus travel time so that we can improve their travel experience.
