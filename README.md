Project Overview
  Public transportation is essential for urban mobility. However, factors like weather, passenger volume, and unforeseen events often lead to unreliable bus schedules. This project aims to develop a more accurate method for predicting travel time between bus stops, improving the efficiency and user experience of Singapore's bus system.

Stakeholders
  Land Transport Authority (LTA): Benefits from optimized scheduling, data-driven decision-making, and improved service quality.
  Passengers: Enjoy a better travel experience with accurate travel time estimates for informed trip planning.

Project Goals
  Predict Station-to-Station Travel Time: Utilize data on passenger flow, rainfall, distance between stops, and date to create a reliable travel time prediction model.
  Optimize Bus Schedules: Provide LTA with insights to refine schedules, reduce delays, and increase service frequency when needed.
  Enhance Passenger Experience: Offer a user-friendly platform where passengers can input their origin and destination to receive estimated travel times.
  Support Data-Driven Decision Making: Provide LTA with comprehensive data to monitor system performance and identify areas for improvement.

Anticipated Outcomes
  Improved reliability and punctuality of bus services.
  Reduced passenger waiting times and frustration.
  Optimized resource allocation for LTA.
  Increased overall satisfaction with public transportation.

Potential Future Development
  Integrate real-time traffic data to further refine predictions.
  Develop a mobile app for easy access to travel time estimates.
  Explore additional factors (e.g., roadworks, special events) that may affect travel time.
  Create a feedback loop for passengers to report actual travel times and improve the model's accuracy.
